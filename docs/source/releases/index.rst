Release Notes
==============

Release notes for Pyrogram releases will describe what's new in each version, and will also make you aware of any backwards-incompatible changes made in that version.

When upgrading to a new version of Pyrogram, you will need to check all the changes in order to find incompatible code in your application, but also to take advantage of new features and improvements.
