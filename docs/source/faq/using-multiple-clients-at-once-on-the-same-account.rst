Using multiple clients at once on the same account
==================================================

User accounts are able to run multiple sessions in parallel. However, you must not use the same session in more than one client at the same time.
The correct way to run multiple clients on the same account is by authorizing your account from the beginning each time, or by using :doc:`Storage Engines <../topics/storage-engines>`, and use one separate session for each parallel client.

It is not recommended to run multiple sessions of bot accounts simultaneously in parallel. If you choose to do so, you **agree** to do so at your own risk and with no liablity to anything.
